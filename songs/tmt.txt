Powers of Thagirion
Watch the great beast to be
For to Mega Therion
The draconian melody
The dragon open the eye
And reveal both truth and lie
Spiritual supremacy
Ride the beast of ecstasy
Spiritual supremacy
Ride the beast of ecstasy
Ialbaoph's creative spark
Manifests the utmost dark
Ialbaoph's creative spark
Meaning the letter of Teth
Hide the force of Baphomet
Meaning the letter of Teth
The wound of Baal will be healed
When sign of time is unsealed
The wound of Baal will be healed
The world will burn by Sorath's flame
And through the solar sign proclaim
Ascending fiend of the sea
Will fulfill prophecy
Man will feel the wrath of beast
When Fenris wolf is released
The dragon open the eye
Reveal both truth and lie
Spiritual supremacy
The end of revelation
A soulful violation
The end of revelation
Bear the mark of victory
And the spear of destiny
Bear the mark of victory

Powers of Thagirion
Watch the great beast to be
The draconian melody
Watch the great beast to be
The world will burn by Sorath's flame
And through the solar sign proclaim
