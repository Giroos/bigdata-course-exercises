Sun enter the Capricorn (and)
The Star of Sin will shine
The King of Sodom drinks again
Lady Babalon's wine
(One) Hundred and Twenty days in the Depth of the Dead sea
And walk the Path of Peccatus
The Setian alchemy
Rise of Sodom
And Gomorrah
Reveal the gnosis
Of Borora
The princess Justine
Sing a song of her sin
Of pleasure and pain
And virtues in vain
To the ear that will hear
And the one without fear
To the old fallen ones and the forbidden thing they all have done
Sun enter the Capricorn (and)
The Star of Sin will shine
The King of Sodom drinks again
Lady Babalon's wine
Rise of Sodom
And Gomorrah
Reveal the gnosis
Of Borora
Hear the king Bera
Cry out in land Canaan
And daughters of Lot
Cry for their father and their god
